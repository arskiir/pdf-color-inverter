# PDF Color Invertor tool

If you want to permanently invert the colour of a pdf not just in read-only mode, like me, this tool is definitely made for you. ðŸ˜‰

## Usage

0. Download and install Python from [this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. Git clone this repo or [download the zip](https://github.com/arskiir/pdf-color-inverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the files
2. Run `python main.py` or double click it. (You may have to run it a few times for the auto dependecy installation to get a hold of itself.)
3. Select one or more pdf files you want to invert
4. ???
5. Profit

## Disclaimer

- The output pdf will be a pdf of images only.
- The texts and other things will become uninteractive.
- Not recommended to "chain" the invertion as file sizes will get bigger and bigger.
