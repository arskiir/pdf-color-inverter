If you want to permanently invert the colour of a pdf not just in read-only mode, like me, this tool is definitely made for you. üòâ

## Usage üõ∏

1. Download and install Python from [this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Git clone this repo or [download the zip](https://github.com/arskiir/pdf-color-inverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the files
3. Run `python main.py` or double click it. (You may have to run it a few times for the auto dependency installation to get a hold of itself.)
4. Select the inversion mode
   - If you are inverting it for the first time, select 1.
   - If you are inverting for the second or more time, select 2.
5. Select one or more pdf files you want to invert
6. ???
7. _Profit_

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

- The output pdf will be a pdf of _images_ only.
- The texts and other things will become _uninteractive_.
- Not recommended to _chain_ the inversion as file sizes will get bigger and bigger.
